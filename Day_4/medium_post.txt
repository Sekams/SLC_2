Eyes on the prize

On this, the fourth day of the Andela Self Learning Clinic, I have come to appreciate how much I have grown as a developer since I applied for the boot camp. There have been some challenges along the way but the amazing spirit of collaboration that dwells within my team mates has seen me through them all. This experience has taught me that no matter how big a challenge one might be facing, with a little help from friends, it can be overcome. This is an attitude I intend to have for the rest of my life because it makes amazing things happen.

Earlier today, I once again came across something that was rather peculiar on the task platform that is used for the to assess the progress of the applicants. There was a question that required the applicants to write a function that implemented the Binary Search algorithm but unlike the previous challenges, this one had no sample unit tests to guide the functionality of the function. This left most of my colleagues confused as to how we should handle this, leading to a lengthy discussion about the matter. After careful consideration of the several suggestionns that were presented, I decided to write my own unit tests prior writing the required function as this was to help me check for any irregularities that might be in the function.

I have now sucessfully completed the tasks for today and also provided as much support and assistance as I could to my challenged colleagues as per the culture in our community of developers, which enabled all of us to be on the same level of progress. I believe that in a team, it does not make sense if there is someone who is doing really well and then having someone else, on the same team who is struggling, those that know more should always help and uplift those that know less, and that way, true collaboration is achieved. I will stop here for now, but leave you with one of my favourite mantras; learning never stops!...#TIA
